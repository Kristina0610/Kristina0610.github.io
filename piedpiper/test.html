          Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and
          other evil corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal

          <br /><br />
          What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of
          knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our
          privacy and freedom.

          powered by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation,
          and end-to-end encryption. <br /><br />
          Put even simpler —
